I was inspired by my own little native flowerbed I've guerrila garden'd from my landlord. I hope I can inspire you to guerrila garden effectively with my native region mapping so we can drive environmental change :)",
        "CONTENT": "What started as a passion project to deliver native plant info quickly evolved into an over-engineered mess built on delivering the fastest query results possible for native plants using the native geolocation api and SSR. Inspired by the design of McMaster-Carr, I was hoping to deliver public plant info to people with lower internet speeds. Please enjoy the fruits of my labor."
